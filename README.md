# Electric Vehicle Market Segmentation

This GitHub repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Segmentation project. The aim of this project was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Indian electric vehicle market, utilizing clustering techniques and demographic data to identify key market segments and potential opportunities.

## Project Overview

The Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Segmentation project is a comprehensive analysis aimed at uncovering key insights into the Indian electric vehicle landscape. By leveraging advanced data analytics techniques, this project seeks to identify distinct market segments and strategic opportunities for market entry and growth. The primary components of the project overview are:

1. **Sophisticated Market Segmentation:**
   - Employed K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms to conduct a detailed market segmentation analysis.
   - Key features, including Price, Top Speed, Charging Time, Riding Range, and demographic factors, were considered to unveil nuanced patterns and preferences within the EV market.

2. **Strategic Targeting of Consumer Bases:**
   - Identified states with a pronounced consumer interest in EVs, emphasizing regions such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.
   - Recognized states boasting a significant number of EV charging stations, such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Karnataka, indicating potential hubs for market penetration.

3. **Consumer-Centric Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - Aligned EV specifications with the preferences of the target consumer segments, particularly focusing on married individuals aged 35-39 who use EVs for daily commuting.
   - Crafted a pricing strategy that caters to the income range and preferences of the identified demographic, ensuring a compelling value proposition.

4. **Customization of Marketing Mix:**
   - Tailored product features, pricing structures, and marketing strategies based on the observed market segmentation insights.
   - Emphasized precision and relevance in product development, aiming to create offerings that seamlessly resonate within the diverse landscape of the Indian electric vehicle market.

5. **Structured Repository for Reproducibility:**
   - Organized the repository into distinct folders, including `/code` for analysis scripts, `/data` for datasets, `/docs` for project documentation, and `/plots` for visualizations, to enhance reproducibility and collaboration.

This project stands as a strategic guide for stakeholders in the electric vehicle industry, providing actionable insights that can inform decision-making processes. The thorough market segmentation analysis ensures that the nuances of consumer behavior and preferences are considered, setting the stage for a targeted and effective approach to product development, marketing, and overall market positioning within the dynamic and evolving Indian electric vehicle landscape.
